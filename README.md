# MonteCarlo
This repository is an example of me making use of a Monte Carlo Simulation. The basic idea is to estimate the mean and standard deviation of a stock prices. With these parameters, you can generate thousands of random walks and come up with a 95% confidence interval, assuming that everything fits a normal distribution.
